## Structure of project
### R folder
This contains final_proj.R file, which has code for the machine learning software and shiny visualizations. This is the main R file. Important note: this should be run *before the shiny app files* as it creates the dataset used in Shiny.
### data
This contains the original SPSS file used from GSS
### shiny
This contains another folder called final_shinyapp, where the app.R file lives. This R file was used to build the Shiny application (linked below). The import.RDS file is the reduced dataset used for Shiny, and rsconnect was produced when the website went live. 
### figs
